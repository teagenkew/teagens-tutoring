# Project Title

Teagen's Tutoring

## Overview

Teagen's Tutoring is a hub for myself and my students, where I will build a collection of notes and quizzes. It will also host a booking page

### Problem Space

I need this app because I don't have a centralized place for my notes and practice problems for my students. It also provides a place for my students to see my availability rather than texting me to find out when we can have a session.

### User Profile

Highschool physics and math students will use this website to learn.

### Features

- a user can acceses notes in physics and math
- a user can access Quizzes in particular topics
- a user can access all practice problems and sort them by tags
- a user can book themselves in with me
- a user can learn about my background in the About section.
